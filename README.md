# MedChat AI
This project implements an AI-powered chatbot specializing in healthcare information. It uses a vector database for efficient information retrieval and a language model for generating responses.

## Features
- Answers medical questions using a combination of pre-stored information and AI-generated responses
- Uses a vector database (Chroma) for efficient information retrieval
- Falls back to a base language model when no relevant information is found in the database
- Preprocesses and splits healthcare data for training and validation
